# Bug Tracker App

A bare-bones full-stack bug tracker built with React, Express, and Vite.  

## Features

- Track bug descriptions, severity, and status.
- Add new bugs via a form.
- Display a list of bugs with color-coded severity and state.

## Lessons Learned

While building this bare-bones full-stack bug tracker, I strengthened several core skills:

- Ensured consistent Node.js environments and explored Docker for reliable setups.
- Deployed a full-stack app on Heroku and managed the code on GitHub.
- Connected a React frontend to an Express backend, handling GET and POST requests.
- Managed React state using `useState` and `useEffect`.
- Planned for persistent database integration using Supabase or PostgreSQL.
- Built the app in real time, reinforcing debugging, problem-solving, and rapid adaptation skills.
