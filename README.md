## Lessons Learned

While building this bare-bones full-stack bug tracker, I learned several key lessons:

- **Environment matters:** Using consistent Node.js versions is critical. Tools like **Docker** can help avoid environment mismatches.  
- **Full-stack deployment:** Deployed the app on **Vercel** and hosted the code on **GitHub**, learning the end-to-end deployment process.  
- **API integration:** Learned how to connect a React frontend to an Express backend and handle GET and POST requests.  
- **State management:** Managed form input and list state in React using **useState** and **useEffect**.  
- **Database planning:** Realized the importance of a persistent database. Plan to use **Supabase** or **PostgreSQL** next.  
- **Problem solving:** Building the app in real time helped reinforce debugging, troubleshooting, and adapting quickly.
